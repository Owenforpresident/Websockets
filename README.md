# Technical Test

## Project Description

This project consists of a frontend and backend application. The frontend is a React-based leaderboard themed around 6-nations rugby, displaying players, their corresponding country avatars along with the number of tries scored and their relative rank. The backend, built with Node.js, provides simulated real-time data updates for the front end application.

## Frontend Setup

In the `frontend` directory, install dependencies:

`npm install`

To start the frontend React application:

`npm start`

To run unit tests:

`npm run test`

## Backend Setup

In the `backend` directory, install dependencies:

`npm install`

To start the backend Node.js application:

`node server.js`

Both applications must be running simultaneously for the dashboard to function correctly.
